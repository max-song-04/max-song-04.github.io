                    In Spring 2025, as the Mark 1 neared launch, I began working as a Structures Engineer for TREL's Orbital Test Stand division, where we aim to create a launch and testing station at the J. J. Pickle Research Campus. This stand was going to reside in a 30-ft hole in the ground with multiple levels and concrete walls. My responsibilities included site modeling, support anchoring analysis, and designing pressure transducer brackets for fluid monitoring during engine testing.

                            <b>Summary: </b> I created a CAD model of the site where the orbital test stand was to be placed, which I endearingly named the Hole. For this project, I was limited to a few photos and videos of the hole and rough dimensions for most of the parts.
                            <br><br>
                            <b>Problem Statement: </b> Create a life-size CAD model of the hole so the Structures teams could place their designed parts into the assembly for ease of integration. This CAD was also used extensively for presentations, including the Preliminary Design Review.
                            <br><br>
                            <b>Project Timeline: </b> Finish as quickly as possible since many other teams depended on my CAD to integrate their work.

                            <b>Design Process: </b> I decided to break down everything in the hole that I needed to CAD into a list, creating priorities to complete by specific presentations. First, I started with the overall CAD of the hole and the shed that was right on top of it. Next, I moved onto each floor and the stairs, making sure to model the metal grating pattern for realism.
                            <br><br>
                            <b>Future Considerations: </b> While this process was enjoyable, I have a few considerations for the future. Initially, I wanted to place each part in the correct positions individually rather than using mates in the assembly, so if one piece was incorrect, another wouldn't be too. However, this ended up being time-consuming to change. Additionally, due to complex geometries, the entire assembly took time to render, so I would likely either decrease details by lowering the metal grating quality or keep everything as a solid body.

                            <b>Summary: </b> The primary support structure holding both the rocket and engines during testing was going to be held by supports anchored to the concrete walls. To accurately calculate the number of bolts necessary, my friend and I were given a paper detailing formulas and variables needed to determine the final bolt diameter, length, required depth of the concrete, plate thickness, and the number of bolts. Our job also extended to modeling a support structure based on our findings, including determining what type of beam to use.

                            <b>Problem Statement: </b> Determine what type and how many bolts are necessary given the horizontal and vertical loads, which were subject to change.

                            <b>Project Timeline: </b> Our timeline was fairly flexible, but we were encouraged to finish in two weeks. However, with the progress my teammate and I made, we were able to finish within a week.

                            <b>Conclusion: </b> Since this was a group project, we were able to cater each part of the project to our strengths. I worked on the initial calculations and Excel sheet while my teammate reformatted and validated each calculation. In the final calculator, I supplemented the document with additional calculations, including the optimal bolt distance and tests to validate the strength at a 4x safety factor. I also created a guide explaining how to use the calculator and each formula used. Following the completion of the calculator, my teammate and I worked on the support structure. Through analysis of beam types that would suit the environment, we determined that an I-beam was the best choice and modeled support structures in SolidWorks.
