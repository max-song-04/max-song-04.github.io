                            <b>Summary: </b> In 2021, my sister suffered a severe injury resulting in chronic back pain. I decided to comfort her in the way I knew best, by making. Observing how music provided her comfort, I was motivated to create something that would make her favorite songs more accessible. After doing some research, I stumbled upon two concepts. One was of a record player and the second was of a speaker that used RFID technology to play songs. I decided to combine these concepts with several repurposed components: a battery from an old power bank, drivers from a water-damaged speaker, and an old Raspberry Pi.

                            <b>Problem Statement: </b> Design a user-friendly device that can play any of my sister’s favorite songs while repurposing existing electronics.

                            <b>Design Process: </b> My approach to this project had a few distinct phases. The first phase was the research and design phase. After determining a turntable as my first problem statement, I looked into both vintage and modern versions. Since I had limited manufacturing methods, I decided to adopt a functionality-first approach where I focused on the components rather than material use. 
                            <br><br>
                            Next, I found the necessary electronics components from Amazon. I purchased an RFID Reader and repurposed an old Raspberry Pi 2, speaker, and battery. Software wise, I decided to use the Spotify API, so I could access my sister’s favorite songs. Since I had initially wanted to store the songs locally, the Raspberry Pi 2 had sufficed, but this need for wifi meant I needed to upgrade to the Pi 4. This phase, although the toughest, was my favorite since it sparked my interest in Python. 
                            <br><br>
                            Finally, I went through the testing phase which was by far the most time consuming. Since I hadn’t worked with electronics in the past, I had to troubleshoot many errors with both my software and hardware.

                            <b>Conclusion: </b> The completed record player achieved its primary goal of providing my sister with music. While working on this project, I also began to develop my own goals which included establishing familiarity with Fusion 360 and a Raspberry Pi which helped me with later projects. Beyond the initial goal, I had quite a few improvements I wanted to take into consideration while designing future projects and later implement into a second iteration of this project. 
                            <br><br>
                            <b>Future Considerations: </b> As one of my first projects, this experience taught me valuable lessons about designing and project management. Without a defined timeline, I occasionally fell into "rabbit holes" with specifics that weren’t important and procrastinated on parts that seemed daunting. In the future, I would like to implement a way to attach the various components to the main body. Though the buttons and knobs were secured via superglue and roughly dimensioned slots, I hope to add screw holes for the Pi and other components. In addition, I hope to add external speakers for increased sound quality. I also would like to increase the similarity to a real record player which would include a motor and needle.
