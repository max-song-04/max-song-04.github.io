                    Below, I have included personal projects that were created for personal use and have a much smaller scope. Currently, the projects listed are a Lamp, Record Player, Phone Case, and Shoe Rack. These projects feature some of my earliest work. In the future, I hope to design more everyday items and experiment with different shapes, materials, and design styles. I generally use Fusion 360 for most of my projects and have a Bambu A1 to 3D print my designs, which I purchased thanks to my freshman summer internship. Enjoy!

                            <b>Summary: </b> I wanted to design a phone case that would allow you to showcase the iPhone's looks without compromising safety. This case featured interconnected PLA bumpers with TPU inserts that would absorb impact. I decided to go with PLA so, in worst case scenario, the case would absorb the impact and crack, rather than the phone. I also designed a wallet that included 3D printed parts.
                            <br><br>
                            <b>Problem Statement: </b> Design a phone case that looks unique compared to other phone cases and uses much less material without compromising its ability to protect my phone. Also, design a MagSafe wallet using both 3D printed parts, magnets, and leather.
                            <br><br>
                            <b>Project Timeline: </b> Finish the final design before my trip to visit my family overseas.

                            <b>Design Process: </b> For this project, I browsed the top phone case brands including Mous and Spigen. For inspiration, I leaned towards heavier-duty cases which I would then strip down. I also browsed Pinterest and Instagram extensively for this project to ensure, one, that no one had created my design, and two, that this design would work. For the overall design, I wanted the case to be in one print and snap on to ensure a snug fit. Once sketching initial designs, I realized there was going to be a tight fit, especially since I wanted to design a MagSafe wallet too. Following this process, I created a CAD and modeled my phone to which I modeled the case around.
                            <br><br>
                            <b>Conclusion: </b> Despite this wallet being just a skeleton, I had dropped it a few times and, it, my phone didn't crack (although the screen protector did, which could still occur even if I had a full case on), which meant I had accomplished my initial goal. I believe this design, although it resembled a bumper case, still looked pretty unique and was able to follow the flow of the iPhone. My only regret is not finishing my wallet in time to carry it during my trip.

                            <b>Future Considerations: </b> Since the sides were thin to ensure a MagSafe wallet or charger could still fit on the back despite not using either of the two, it snapped while tugging on a corner of my pocket during my trip. I'm currently working on a second iteration that includes double railing on the sides to also further protect the front side of the screen. My first model also included TPU bumpers in the corner, but since I didn't have an enclosed 3D printer, the TPU prints consistently failed, so I didn't include the bumpers in the model I carried to visit my relatives. I'm also considering using a higher resolution printer like an SLA printer or even SLS, resources both available at Texas Inventionworks. For the wallet, I hope to gain access to spring steel sheets which should better maintain pressure on the cards for easier removal. This was an issue with the PETG that I printed with since it didn't maintain enough pressure on the cards.

                            <b>Summary: </b> I had an LED Desk Lamp that worked amazingly, but the plastic base cracked after being bent too far. I wanted to retain some of the same features, including an adjustable light, but this time I wanted to have the ability to change the color temperature. For this project, I wanted to design and create each part of the lamp except the electronics.
                            <br><br>
                            <b>Problem Statement: </b> Create a desk lamp with electronics that are easily replicable so this same idea could be applied to different lamps for future projects.
                            <br><br>
                            <b>Design Process: </b> For this lamp, I wanted to create something similar to my old lamp but without moving parts to prevent the same issues from occurring. While the design phase went through quite a few iterations, I wanted to spend more time on the electronics. I hoped to take the electronics from this project and apply them in future projects. Some ideas in mind include a light bar for the top of my monitor and a reading bar above my bed. This means that the electronics have a small form factor with easy adjustability and customizability.

                            <b>Progress Check: </b> So far, this project has taught me a lot about electronics integration into a print. During my first iteration of the electronics, I placed my batteries in series and used two buck converters (I needed two since the LED light strip requires 12V while the microcontroller requires 5V), which led to a very inefficient use of power and an extremely low current that struggled to keep up with the setup. My second iteration included batteries put in parallel and two voltage boosters, which also had a much smaller form factor than the buck converters. Right now, I'm working on creating this lamp to be structurally sound despite having to be printed in multiple parts.

                            <b>Summary: </b> In the first few months of living in an apartment, I had a pile of shoes sitting outside my apartment door. In an effort to organize my apartment, I designed a shoe rack that was easily modifiable to fit any apartment with bulk dowels I had purchased for my small business years earlier.
                            <br><br>
                            <b>Problem Statement: </b> Create a shoe rack that wouldn't require screws or adhesive, allow for modifiable dimensions, be easy to assemble/disassemble to accommodate moving, and reuse old materials. But, most importantly, be considerably cheaper than purchasing a shoe rack.
                            <br><br>
                            <b>Project Timeline: </b> I took up this project during finals week in order to give me to take a break from studying. I also wanted to finish this project before I left for break.
                            <br><br>
                            <b>Design Process: </b> During middle school and into high school, I participated in Odyssey of the Mind or OM. Part of OM was to build props for a skit which would sometimes involve using PVC pipes. Since I had old dowels lying around, I realized I just needed to design connectors which would accomplish all my initial goals. With 3D printing, I realized this could be very cheap accomplishing my last goal. Regarding aesthetics, I wanted to emphasize the hybridization of woodworking and 3D printing by using white connectors which would complement the light birch dowels.

                            <b>Conclusion: </b> The dowels were fairly uneven, so it meant my tolerancing had to give enough room without needing epoxy or CA glue. For printing, I used 10% infill, but 3 wall loops for press-fit structural integrity. In total, the print used around 450g of PLA filament which, at $8.99 a kg (bulk from Kingroon), yielded a printing cost of $4.05. Looking back at my past order, I paid $21 for 25 dowels which means each dowel cost $0.84. I made a 4-foot-long shoe rack which totaled 6 dowels or $5.04. In total, this cost $9.09. On average, on Amazon, shoe racks of these dimensions, although made from metal, cost on average around $23, so I consider this project a success.
                            <br><br>
                            <b>Future Considerations: </b> In the future, I believe adding a finishing oil to the wooden dowels would help with tolerancing since the wood would expand as it absorbs the oil. In addition, I could add a hole in the connectors in case I find a more permanent residence. In addition, screwing into the wood would allow for the wood to expand for a better fit.
